Components Plan:

<Header />:

-contains the logo 
- contains the search bar
- search bar has local state
- on submit the search bars local state updates the "reddit: searchTerm" state in store

<Posts />:

- The main body which contains all of the Posts
- Maps through the posts state and returns a <Post /> component for each, keyed with some unique ID from each posts state. 
- <Posts/> component accesses the "posts" state from store - passing to each <Post/> component as props
- Minimum props <Post/> will need - post title, vote count, thumbnail, post author, posted at/ago time, comments


<Post />:

- Renders the Post using props passed from <Posts/> container
- Can layout the component as a grid with 1 row and 2 columns (1fr 4fr). Then vote box goes in left column, rest of content goes in right column.
- Each column of the grid is a flexbox with direction column
- Left side is one element - the voting card. Right side is three elements - title, thumbnail, footer *might be a good idea to split each element of the post into seperate components at some point*
- Will have local state which holds vote count - equal to vote count grabbed from state on renders
- Functions to handle up/downvotes and update local state as such

<Subreddits />

- A container which has all of my Subreddits
- Will map through the subreddits contained in the "subreddits" state and render a <Subreddit /> component
- Passes props to each <Subreddit /> component.
- Minimum props needed to pass to each <Subreddit /> component - subreddit name, subreddit r/xyz path, subreddit icon
