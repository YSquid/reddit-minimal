1. Create a function that fetches a posts array from the reddit API using fetch - how do I only grab X amount of posts? DONE
2. Call the fetching posts function with useEffect on load, save to Posts local state. DONE
3. Create a redditSlice - one of its properties is posts. DONE
4. Have an addPost action which takes a post payload (one of the items in my post array) and creates the post in state (see topicsSlice example for flashcards) DONE
5. After I fetch the posts, dispatch the addPost action for each post in the array DONE

From what I can tell I can make a request to something like reddit.com/r/pics.json and get the raw JSON for that page
The page will have a "Listing" whose "data" property then holds the posts. The data prop has a few different things, but the one I care about it "children" which reutrns an array of objects. 
Each object has "kind", and data - the data about each post. 

Next steps to flesh it out:

1) How do I access a higher quality preview image? use the url as the preview image - if gallery show nothing. DONE
2) Add votes count, time added, to state DONE
3) Convert time in UNIX to 'x hours, days, months' etc ago.  DONE


Updating preview rules:

1. Change the conditional so that showUrl is true is post.url contains either .jpg or .png DONE
2. For ones with no showUrl, display a placeholder reddit icon DONE

*Add in the subreddit before the author name*
