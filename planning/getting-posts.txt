1. Create a function that fetches a posts array from the reddit API using fetch - how do I only grab X amount of posts?
2. Call the fetching posts function with useEffect on load
3. Create a redditSlice - one of its properties is posts
4. Have an addPost action which takes a post payload (one of the items in my post array) and creates the post in state (see topicsSlice example for flashcards)
5. After I fetch the posts, dispatch the addPost action for each post in the array
